## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**DRAISS-VRU** is a dynamic perception-driven framework that proactively protects Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs)â€”especially pedestriansâ€”by integrating:

- **Real-time object detection**
- **Intent estimation**
- **Risk scoring**
- **Override control simulation**
- **Acoustic warning system**

This project simulates a unified safety system specifically designed for **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** and **Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)** using MATLAB Simulink.

> ðŸ“„ This repository hosts the **technical project files**, including:
- MATLAB `.slx` simulation model
- Python code for risk estimation
- AVAS logic design
- Technical Report (Unpublished Draft)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### 1. **Perception Layer (YOLOv8-based)**
- Real-time pedestrian detection from camera feed using YOLOv8.
- Supports bounding box extraction and zone classification.
- Configurable for integration with LiDAR and RADAR (future upgrade).

### 2. **Intent Estimation**
- Zone-based logic (crosswalk, curbside, approach angle).
- Movement tracking to determine if a pedestrian intends to cross.

### 3. **Risk Scoring Engine**
- Python-based model using **XGBoost** classifier.
- Calculates risk levels based on velocity, intent, and proximity.
- Integrated into Simulink via MATLAB Function Block using `py.*`.

### 4. **Simulink-Based Simulation**
- Simscape vehicle modeling for kinematic behavior.
- Real-time simulation of vehicle override based on risk.
- Full vehicle path behavior simulation using input from the risk model.

### 5. **AVAS (Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System)**
- Dynamic AVAS tone modulation (volume + frequency) based on:
  - Risk level
  - Pedestrian distance
  - Intent probability
- Based on **AIS 138** standards for quiet EV pedestrian alerts.
